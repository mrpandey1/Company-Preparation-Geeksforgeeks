Approach: For a given perimeter of cuboid we have P = 4(l+b+h) —(i), 
for given area of cuboid we have A = 2 (lb+bh+lh) —(ii). 
Volume of cuboid is V = lbh
Volume is dependent on 3 variables l, b, h. Lets make it dependent on only length.

as V = lbh, 
=> V = l (A/2-(lb+lh)) {from equation (ii)} 
=> V = lA/2 – l2(b+h) 
=> V = lA/2 – l2(P/4-l) {from equation (i)} 
=> V = lA/2 – l2P/4 + l3 —-(iii)
Now differentiate V w.r.t l for finding maximum of volume. 
dV/dl = A/2 – lP/2 + 3l2 
After solving the quadratic in l we have l = (P – (P2-24A)1/2) / 12 
Substituting value of l in (iii), we can easily find the maximum volume
'''

def getVol(P, A):
    l = (P - math.sqrt(P * P - 24 * A)) / 12
    V = l * (A / 2.0 - l * (P / 4.0 - l))
    return int(V)
A=20
b=14
print(getVol(20,14))
